/*
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

These are more details:

    VAR ^ 4,
    if there is no 4 in VAR, means SAVE 4 into VAR.
    if there is 4 in VAR, means CLEAR 4 from VAR.

    7 & (~4) = 3, means CLEAR 4 from 7.

    VAR & (-4), means CLEAR 4 form VAR.

For example, an array {1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 7, 2 }

        1        2       2       1         1       7     2
  one  [1]     [1,2]    [1]    [null]    [null]   [7]   [7] (<=Answer)
  two  [null]  [null]   [2]    [1,2]     [2]      [2]   [0]
